# Interactivity

Interactive pages can be distinguished by the "\[Interactive\]" tag behind the title. These pages have additional
functionalities that can be explored, such as simulations. Since these simulations are made using code, we provide
specific instructions to show how to make them interactive, such as by tuning experimental parameters. Please take a
look at the figures below for more information on how to do this.
