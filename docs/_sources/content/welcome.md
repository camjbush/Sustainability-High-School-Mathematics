# Sustainability in High School Mathematics

% NOTE: Could do quizzes via https://github.com/jmshea/jupyterquiz
% Also: https://jmshea.github.io/Foundations-of-Data-Science-with-Python/intro.html
% Idea: make different notebooks for theory and implementation to avoid cluttering (use sections)

Welcome to the open-source project about **sustainability in high school mathematics**! We are happy that you have 
decided to give our project a try.

**Origin**:
This project has been developed by Lars Quaedvlieg, Etienne Chassaing, and Cameron Bush (see the {doc}`credits <./credits>` page for 
more information), for the "HUM-433 How People Learn II" course at 
[École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/how-people-learn-designing-learning-tools-ii-HUM-433)

**Goals**:
The project aims to integrate sustainability into high school mathematics education by creating a platform that allows 
students and teachers to easily *access* and *contribute* to a library of sustainability-themed exercises and interactive 
showcasings. The exercises will provide an opportunity for students to apply mathematical concepts to real-world 
sustainability problems, thereby improving their understanding of sustainability and enhancing their problem-solving 
skills. Furthermore, the platform is *accessible on any device* like a laptop, tablet, phone, etc.

**Target Audience**:
The target audience of the project is *high school students and teachers*, with a focus on integrating sustainability into high school mathematics education.

We are excited to share more information about our project with you, so please explore our website to learn more. Thank you for your interest in our work!

```{admonition} If you are interesting in helping...
You are encouraged to **contribute** to this project! If you are interested, reach out 
[by e-mail](mailto:lars.quaedvlieg@epfl.ch) or help out by contributing to the 
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/lars-quaedvlieg/Sustainability-High-School-Mathematics).
```

## Book content

The content on the platform will be organized into three layers:

1. Independent exercises that can be used in their affiliated math chapter
2. Topics that are reused in a few math chapters
3. Topics that are deepened through a jupyter-notebook activity such as a small simulation.

```{important}
As a **teacher**, you do not need to have any experience with programming (jupyter notebook) to use the book! We have made it 
**easy-to-use**, and have released a {doc}`user guide <./user_guide>` over here. Do not worry! It is easy to use and you
will be able to get started **within minutes**!
```

The platform will also include **interactive simulations and visualizations** to illustrate sustainability concepts and 
mathematical models, and statistical methods and data analysis to assess the effectiveness of sustainability initiatives.

The book is open-source and will hopefully keep growing with the help of amazing people. For now, in order to get started,
simply click on the topic you want to see, on the left navigation bar. Alternatively, check out the {doc}`user guide <./user_guide>`
to get started or learn about advanced features.
